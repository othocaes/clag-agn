Ok, a quick summary of what we talked about doing for next week:

1) Make the 18 panel figures with PSD and lag for the 4 frequency bin case
2) Make an 18 panel figure that overlays the 4-bin and 7-bin cases.
3) Try 5 bins and 6 bins: how many wavelengths fully coverage for each?  Make 18 panel figures for these too, so we can compare everything
4) Write out ascii files with: low frequency, high frequency, PSD and Lag for each wavelength.  This will be what I need to try and fit the lags and PSDsâ€¦..
